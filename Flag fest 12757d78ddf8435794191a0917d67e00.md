Self-Reference is the key isn't it?
 
anyways here's the flag=4749213018208329092654417566871950218631663714830909948050110410794128872161939738850463928125422683587434946200389398886254203042228541925380086594693658164989057675305874475271459942048251502791707388022704880600504697005283242673076645797196434201076429298534951824075877110135130727350950496352627723629997658461125093127672299736847395099602302495143557586363495426792588118195113195432735999029104113679291418989675914077422362753091844830996144020826556114305391099544416455782237793701952805648702254287372913472408955070595203080704

## 2.  Amazing one

1. Given a file contains binary strings.
2. uploaded to cyberchef.

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%202.png)

1. From binary > base58 > found png header.
2. After rendering it found a image containing hex code.
3. Upon decoding the hex got our desired flag.

## 3. Git Guru

---

1. Provided a zip file containing `.git` folder. So it’s obvious a git repo. Upon extracting it found these :

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%203.png)

1. These are fake flags and i’ve searched every files but no luck! 
2. in [Readme.md](http://Readme.md) i found a hint .

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%204.png)

1. In git you can see the log history where developer may remove some files or edited , changed and updated their commit. so i decided to check that out.
2. `git log`  

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%205.png)

1. to see those commit use `git show <some digit of hash value>` 

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%206.png)

see we got first flag. 

so I tried to gather all the hash value from here and try to see the contents. but I only got the `first` flag. 

`git log`  command isn’t working here. After some research I found a useful one.

`git rev-list --objects --all`  and boom!

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%207.png)

Got all the commits. 

1. I made a bash script that will run that command, grab the commit hashes and execute one by one in `git show` command 

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%208.png)

```python
for i in $(git rev-list --objects --all | cut -d " " -f 1); do git show $i; done
```

- `git rev-list --objects --all` : will show all the commit hash along with file name.
- `cut -d " " -f 1` : will keep 1st column which is commit hash and remove the rest.
- `git show` : will show the content of those commit by using commit hashes.
- `for i in $(command) ; do command $i; done` : is a one liner in bash which helped me automate this process by grabbing the commit hashes and using it in git show command to show the contents of each commit.

and you’ll start seeing all the commit history and their contents including those which are deleted or changed by the developer.

you’ll see the flag is divided into 3 pieces and was hidden in different places.

**1st part.**

# Category: Cryptography

## 1. Fence system

1. Given a a string.
2. `fafs{5t4__3c_ytm0_o?lgeti_ht4fnEss3_rwT}`
3. i solved it manually. The flag format should be `flagfest` . but i have `fafs`. so missing letters are `lget` . If you look at the strings carefully, you can find those letters after `?` . 
4. So what i did, I split them like this for easy decode.

> `fafs{5t4__3c_ytm0_o?
lgeti_ht4fnEss3_rwT}`
> 
1. Now take one letter from upper line and one letter from the lower line.
2. And we got the flag.

`flagfest{i5_th4t_4_f3ncE_syst3m_0r_woT?}`

# Category: Web.

## 1. Granny’s Secret.

1. Given a link of the challenge website. 
2. Upon visiting the link there was nothing interesting.
3. look for source , robots.txt nothing is interesting.
4. so I tried to proxy the request through `burpsuite` to see what’s going on!
5. Found a get request which using cookie header. and there is a `user=dXNlcg%3D%3D` param.

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%2012.png)

1. upon Decoding it from `base64` found `user=user` . Don’t forget to replace `%3D%3D` to `==` otherwise you may get some unwanted characters.
2. Now just change user to `admin` , encode with base64 and send the request.
3. Flag is in the response.

> We are given a zip file containing a system folders and file of `C:` Drive of windows 10. 

After analyzing the folder, found bunch of `log files` `evtx files` and a `output` folder. this folder contains a bunch of `.csv` files which are nothing but log files which are parsed via `mftecmd` tool . you can find more from here: [https://binaryforay.blogspot.com/2018/06/introducing-mftecmd.html](https://binaryforay.blogspot.com/2018/06/introducing-mftecmd.html)

## 1. Victim name.

i was exploring the folders manually and suddenly caught attention on different browsers data. and i found an email address which belongs to victim.

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%2013.png)

So i did some `Email Osint` in online and found his real name.

## 2. Time zone:

which time zone the victim use?

After a doing a research for a while I found that the time zone information should be located at the `registry` in `ControlSet001\Control\TimeZoneInformation` path. and in the `output folder`  i saw a folder called registry which contains the registry logs in `.csv` format.

![Untitled](Flag%20fest%2012757d78ddf8435794191a0917d67e00/Untitled%2016.png)

in that file i searched for that `ControlSet001\Control\TimeZoneInformation` path and found it.
